# SMS-Spam-or-Ham-Hugging-Face

Here I used the Hugging Face classification model - DistilBertForSequenceClassification to determine whether the SMS is spam or ham.

The source of the dataset is https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset

The accuracy and the f1 score on the validation dataset is 99.6% and 99.7% respectively.
The accuracy and the f1 score on the testing dataset is slighly lower i.e. 98.6% and 99.2% respectively.
